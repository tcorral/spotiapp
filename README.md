# spotiapp
Angular 7 app using Spotify Developers API

## Steps
1. Resources provided for the app have been added to the resources folder.
2. Create a new Angular app:
```javascript
ng new spotiapp
```
3. Create a new app in Spotify:

    * Open https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard in your browser
    * Login or sign-up
    * Click in button **Create a client ID**
        - Step 1
            * App or Hardware Name = **spotiapp**
            * App or Hardware Description = **Spotify Training App**
            * What are you building = **Website**
            * Click **Next** button.
        - Step 2
            * Are you developing a commercial integration? = **No**
        - Step 3
            * Check all the checkboxes.
            * Click **Submit** button

    Once you have finished the creation process, you are presented with the details of your new app. From this page you have to store in a save place two things:

    * Client ID
    * Client Secret

    These two hashes will be needed to interact with the Spotify REST API.
